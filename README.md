# My macOS setup

> List of applications and tools that make my macOS experience better.

## General

All of my apps are in one virtual desktop per screen only. I've tried experimenting with multiple desktops grouped by category/projects etc. but I've found that I end up spending too much time searching and switching between multiple desktops. YMMV.
